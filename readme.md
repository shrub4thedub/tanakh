# tanakh

simple command line tool for searching the hebrew bible


## how
put the txt and sh in the same folder
edit tanakh.sh to use the right filepath by changing the TEXT_FILE variable at the top of the file
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrub4thedub/tanakh
cd tankah
chmod +x tanakh.sh
./tanakh.sh genesis 1
```

outputs hebrew first, then english, no formatting

that's it
